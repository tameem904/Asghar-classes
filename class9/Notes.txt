Arrays:
    Arrays are collection of items. We can store primitive and non-primitive data
    inside arrays.
Why we should learn about arrays?
    1)They help us manage large amounts of data efficiently.
    2) we can process the data stored in arrays using loops
syntax:
    we have two ways of creating the arrays
   1) datatype [] name={element 1,element 2,element 3};
   example int[] number={10,20,60}
   2) datatype[] name=new datatype[size]
   int [] numbers= new int [5]
Enhanced For loop:
    its another type of loop that we can use with data structures it automatically
    picks the items from the array and prints them one by one in each iteration.
Why should we use Enhanced?
    1) its cleaner code
    2) it's easier to understand.
Syntax:
    for(datatype variable:arrayName){

    }
Limitations of the Enhanced for loop:
    1) There is no index which means we will always get the data in the
    sequence it is present in the array
    2) we can't print the items in reverse order.
    3)we can't update the values as well.


Shortcuts:
    1)after the array type iter and intellij will write a enhanced for loop for you
    2) we can place the cursor on the for loop and click on the bulb icon to change
    one loop with another one.
